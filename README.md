💡 Overview

Naari Shakti AI is a smart mobile application designed to bridge the gap between women’s safety needs and existing fragmented solutions.
By integrating AI, real-time technology, and legal support, it aims to empower women with safety, justice, and community confidence — all in one platform.

🚨 Problem Statement

In 2025, safety remains an unresolved issue for women — at home, work, or in public spaces.
Despite advancements in technology, current safety systems fail to provide comprehensive protection and support.

⚠️ Challenges Faced:

Fragmented Safety Systems: Limited to SOS or basic location sharing without real-time updates.

Lack of Evidence: Difficulty in collecting reliable proof during emergencies or legal cases.

Limited Legal Aid: Women struggle to find accessible and trustworthy legal assistance.

Fear & Insecurity: Lack of assurance while commuting or being alone in public spaces.

👉 There is an urgent need for a holistic, accessible, and intelligent solution that ensures real-time safety and empowerment for women.

💪 Proposed Solution

Naari Shakti AI provides a complete safety ecosystem using artificial intelligence and location-aware technology.
It goes beyond basic alerts to ensure prevention, protection, and post-incident support.

🔐 Core Safety Features

🆘 SOS Activation: Sequential emergency calls and SMS alerts to trusted contacts.

📍 Adaptive Location Updates: Sends live location only when the user moves more than 80 meters — preserving battery and privacy.

🎥 Evidence Capture: Background video recording auto-uploads to trusted contacts for proof and protection.

🗺️ Safe Path Navigation: Suggests the shortest and safest route using crime heatmaps powered by the A* algorithm.

⚖️ Legal Assistance

🤖 AI Chatbot: Offers instant legal guidance and rights awareness.

📝 Complaint Drafting: Auto-generates structured legal forms and stores them securely.

🧑‍⚖️ Community & Support

💬 Pro Bono Platform: Connects women with verified lawyers for free legal aid.

✅ Lawyer Verification: Every lawyer is validated via Bar ID and admin approval to ensure authenticity.
