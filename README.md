Problem Statement:

In 2025, safety remains an unresolved issue for women — whether at home, at work, on the streets, or online. Despite technological advancements, current safety measures still fail to bridge the gap between existing systems and the real needs of women.

Fragmented Safety Systems: Existing measures are limited to basic SOS alerts or location sharing, lacking timely updates and actionable responses.

Lack of Evidence: When seeking justice, women often face difficulty in gathering reliable evidence, which complicates legal action.

Legal Aid Accessibility: There’s a lack of accessible, affordable, and trustworthy legal assistance for women in distress.

Fear and Uncertainty: The absence of safety assurance in public spaces, particularly while commuting, leads to constant fear instead of security.

There is an urgent need for a comprehensive, reliable, and accessible solution that goes beyond fragmented systems and offers true safety and empowerment to women.

Proposed Solution:

Naari Shakti AI offers a holistic approach to women’s safety by integrating AI and technology to provide real-time safety features, legal assistance, and community support.

Core Safety Features

SOS Activation: Sequential calls and SMS alerts to trusted contacts.

Adaptive Location Updates: Sends location updates only if the user moves more than 80 meters.

Evidence Capture: Automatically records background videos and uploads them securely to trusted contacts.

Safe Path Navigation: Provides the shortest and safest route with a crime heatmap, using the A* algorithm.

Legal Assistance

AI Chatbot: Provides legal guidance and rights awareness.

Complaint Drafting: Auto-generates legal forms for complaints, stored securely.

Community & Support

Pro Bono Platform: Connects victims with verified lawyers.

Lawyer Verification: Ensures lawyer credibility via Bar ID and admin approval.

Technologies Used

Kotlin for Android app development

AI and Machine Learning: For crime prediction and safe path navigation

Firebase: For real-time location updates

A Algorithm:* For route optimization and crime heatmapping
